### **What to Do Next**

1.  **Replace the code** in your `main.py` file with the new, corrected version above.
2.  **Commit and push** this one-line change to your GitHub repository.
3.  **Render will automatically deploy** the fix.

After this, your bot will start successfully. This was a minor oversight, and the fix is very straightforward.
